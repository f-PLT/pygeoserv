# pygeoserv

Small experimental project for a module built around Geoserver's API for a more 
automated publishing of shapefiles and other data types.

This module is meant to be used on the machine or host running a Geoserver instance, 
as it requires access to the file system for layer creation.

## Requirements

Outside of the package requirements, to use or test Pygeoserv, you need to install
Docker and Docker Compose on the system running it.
